# Project-SOC
 This a is a bash script designed to allow a user to choose between 3 types of attacks (Nmap, masscan, medusa) on a host machine using functions. The type of attack executed will be saved in a log file in var/log for further analysis and documentations.
 There are 2 objectives for this project. First, to automate task in bash script. Second, to understand the possibile vulnerabilities between the network interactions of client and server in the real world
